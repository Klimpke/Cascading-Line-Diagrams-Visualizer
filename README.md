# Visualization of Statistical Information in Concept Lattice Diagrams
By Jana Klimpke and Sebastian Rudolph

## Basics
This repository contains the source code for a program that can display both additive line diagrams and cascading additive line diagrams. 

Cascading additive line diagrams are a visualization method that combines the properties of additive line diagrams with association analysis. They are described in more detail in our paper "Visualization of Statistical Information in Concept Lattice Diagrams", which we submitted to ICFCA 2021.

## Program
Our program allows the input of a formal context as a cross table.The output happens as additive line diagram and cascading line diagram. The user can change the diagrams by dragging and dropping the irreducible nodes, which are marked by green squares.

The program was written in Java and tested in Ubuntu 16.04.
